# BigQueryInGCP
IDS706 Project #5: Cloud SQL 
By Weiliang Hu

## Summary
In this project, I will explore some insights using the Iowa Liquor Retail Sales Data. 

The Data would be explored inside the Big Query Platform in GCP. 

In addition to the result of SQL queries, I would also make plots using the GCP Cloud SQL UI. I find it efficient and enjoyable getting insights through the different plotting and visualizing UIs from Big Query Platform.

### Database Visualization summaries:
The most popular consumed liquor is Black Velvet.

The store that had the most gallons of liquor sold is Hy-Vee #3 / BDI / Des Moine.

Each year the liquor sold in the Hy-Vee stores are gradually increasing.

### Statistical EDA summaries:

The price of the alcohol division paid for each bottle produced may not be a significant predictor for the volumed of alcohol sold in gallons.

Interaction may exist between county and the product of liquor.
